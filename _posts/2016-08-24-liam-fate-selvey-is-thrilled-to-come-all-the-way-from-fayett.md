Liam Fate Selvey is thrilled to come all the way from Fayetteville, Arkansas. He has been entertaining audiences with his gravity-defying juggling and razor wit for over twenty years. A second generation performer, he was mentored in juggling and comedy by his father from the age of nine. He has appeared on stage in a plethora of plays, including _The Complete Works of Shakespeare (abridged), Cabaret, Plan 9 From Outer Space (the musical), _and _Up_.

Liam's current home is Planet Earth, where he can be found all over the United States performing at Renaissance Festivals and other events. In addition, he is a highly lauded circus skills instructor who regularly works with the [National Circus Project][0] in New York. In 2011, he wrote, directed, and performed in a critically acclaimed one person show about his father's career as an entertainer called _Harmless: a juggler's story_.

He is always looking for ways to create more wonder and excitement in the world by incorporating circus into unexpected situations.
