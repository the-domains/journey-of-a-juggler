August 24, 2016

The first weekend of the Michigan Renaissance Festival went so well, this weekend should be twice as good! I am so happy to be back for my second year on the Treetop Stage! The Harmless Danger Juggling Show will be happening at 11:00, 12:30, 2:15, & 4:45 every Saturday and Sunday through October 2! Plus, of course, any stray Mondays or Fridays the festival finds itself open. I hope to see everybody there! 

On a more personal note: I am settling in to my new home, which is a microcamper trailer parked in my friend's backyard (fig. 1). Don't worry, it has A/C and a PS4\. I am also really excited about my newest prop, which should be arriving in the mail today! Do you want to know what it is? DO YOU?! Okay, I'll tell you. It's a flaming chain sword. YEAH! I can't wait to put it in the show this weekend. Don't miss the epic debut Saturday morning! Stay tuned for pictures/accident reports!
